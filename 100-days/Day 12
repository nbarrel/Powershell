#Get WMIobject vs Get-CimInstance

#CIM, Common Information Model, is an open-source standard for retrieving, displaying, and managing computer, network, application, and services information

#WMI, which stands for Windows Management Instrumentation, This is good for windows only :(

# Get information about the operating system using Get-WmiObject
$os = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem
Write-Host "Operating System: $($os.Caption)"
Write-Host "Version: $($os.Version)"
Write-Host "Last Boot Up Time: $($os.ConvertToDateTime($os.LastBootUpTime))"

# Get information about the operating system using Get-CimInstance
$os = Get-CimInstance -ClassName CIM_OperatingSystem
Write-Host "Operating System: $($os.Caption)"
Write-Host "Version: $($os.Version)"
Write-Host "Last Boot Up Time: $($os.LastBootUpTime)"
