# Files and directories
#lets interact and create/modify simple files and directories


$Text = echo "Have a wonderful day!" 
$pathtofile = "c:\test\createdfile.txt"

#Lets see if the file exists and if it does not exist we can create it
#this can be done many ways; the best way IMO is a simple if statement



if(Test-Path -Path $pathtofile )
{
Write-Host "$pathtofile exists"
}
else
{
Write-Host "$pathtofile is not present creating path"

}

#appending it will write to a new line. That is helpful when creating a loggging script
