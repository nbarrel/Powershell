100 days by nbarrel

Today I have come back to reignite my daily coding habits, due to personal circumstances coding took a back burner in my life.

Time to take charge and get back up the saddle 

This will be a 100 day challenge for all 3 of the languages I learned they will all have the same parameters and outcomes. The limitations will be only of my own.
